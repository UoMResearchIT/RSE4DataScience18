## How to onboard yourself into a new unfamiliar domain
 - Talk to people, be excited about their subject to get conversation started
 - Youtube videos or podcasts - by domain experts
 - Recommended reading list
 - Lists of software/tools commonly used in area, eg Matlab Python etc - Arrangement of licensing to access
 - View example datasets/scripts
 - Shadowing domain expert to see what they do
 - Sneaking in the back of an undergraduate or masters lecture
 - Glossary of terms, request initial contribution from domain specialist adding to it as you go on the project
 - Portability of outputs, eg to csv or domain specific software
 - Whether to embed yourself with the research group

## How to bring software engineering best practice to a domain you're working in
 - Guest lectures
 - Software/Data Carpentry courses - advertising!
 - Make tools/services as easy as possible to use - GUI over command line where appropriate
 - Focus on building blocks as an abstraction over a programming language
 - Carrot/Stick approach to requests for help on things like Git, needs careful relationship management
 - Incentivizing 
 - Encourage self learning, usually after an intial workshop or course
 - Use analogies to bridge gap between domains (build up a library of examples?)
