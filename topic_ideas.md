Topic Ideas
===========

* Who is an RSE, who is a data scientist?
* What does CI look like for data analysis scripts in Jupyter?
* Good data science working practices. What can we use from software engineering practices? What needs to be different? Are these just good reproducible research practices or something different?
* How do we generate test data sets that are minimal, but that we know provide full coverage of the problem space? Can we do this automatically? For all types of data?
